[![build](https://github.com/k1LoW/gh-setup/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/k1LoW/gh-setup/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k1LoW/octocovs/main/badges/k1LoW/gh-setup/coverage.svg) ![Code to Test Ratio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k1LoW/octocovs/main/badges/k1LoW/gh-setup/ratio.svg)

Key features of `gh-setup` are:

- **For setup, detect the version, the appropriate GitHub Releases asset, the asset's compressed format, and the executable path where the binary will be installed.**
- **Works as a GitHub CLI extension (or a standalone CLI) as well as a GitHub Action.**

## As a GitHub CLI extension

### Usage

``` console
$ gh setup --repo k1LoW/tbls
Use tbls_v1.62.0_darwin_arm64.zip
Setup binaries to executable path (PATH):
  tbls -> /Users/k1low/local/bin/tbls
$ tbls version
1.62.0
```

### Install

``` console
$ gh extension install k1LoW/gh-grep
```

## As a GitHub Action

### Usage

``` yaml
# .github/workflows/doc.yml
[...]
    steps:
      -
        name: Setup k1LoW/tbls
        run: k1LoW/gh-setup@v0
        with:
          github-token: ${secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}
          repo: k1LoW/tbls
        # version: v1.60.0
        # os: linux
        # arch: amd64
